## Project Ideas

1. **AI Inference**
   - [AI Inference](ideas/ai-inference.md)
   - Summary: Implement AI inference onchain using EigenLayer to leverage its decentralized trust and economic mechanisms, ensuring program integrity, session privacy, and supporting federated learning.

2. **Inbound and Outbound Bridge**
   - [Inbound and Outbound Bridge](ideas/inbound-outbound-bridge.md)
   - Summary: Utilize a decentralized network of relay operators on EigenLayer to enhance the resilience and security of cross-chain bridges.

3. **Keeper Network**
   - [Keeper Network](ideas/keeper-network.md)
   - Summary: Deploy nodes to respond to 'if-this-then-that' demands for both non-time-sensitive and time-sensitive actions, leveraging Ethereum inclusion trust via EigenLayer.

4. **MEV Management**
   - [MEV Management](ideas/mev-management.md)
   - Summary: Introduce MEV-Boost+ and MEV-Boost++ to enable proposers to have both transaction inclusion power and MEV rewards, enhancing Ethereumâ€™s liveness and censorship resistance.

5. **Relay Networks**
   - [Relay Networks](ideas/relay-networks.md)
   - Summary: Implement a decentralized network of relay operators on EigenLayer to support bridge operations and provide dApp developers with robust and flexible bridging solutions.

6. **Reorg Resistance**
   - [Reorg Resistance](ideas/reorg-resistance.md)
   - Summary: Develop a service to guarantee nodes with substantial stake in Ethereum attest to the block header of the most recently finalized block, ensuring resistance to chain reorganizations.

7. **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Committees**
   - [Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Committees](ideas/tee-committes.md)
   - Summary: Construct decentralized TEE Committees through EigenLayer, enhancing the reliability of any committee by requiring multiple distinct TEE models and economic trust.

8. **Threshold Cryptography**
   - [Threshold Cryptography](ideas/threshold-cryptography.md)
   - Summary: Implement threshold cryptography using EigenLayer nodes to perform distributed computation on encrypted data, delivering robust privacy guarantees.

9. **Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**
   - [Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)](ideas/threshold-fhe.md)
   - Summary: Enable distributed computation on encrypted data using EigenLayer nodes for threshold FHE, ensuring privacy and security while performing computations on sensitive data.
