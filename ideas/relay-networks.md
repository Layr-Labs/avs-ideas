# Relay Networks

## Summary
Enhance the resilience of bridges by utilizing a decentralized network of relay operators on EigenLayer. This approach mitigates the reliance on centralized groups of relayers, providing dApp developers with more robust and flexible bridging options.

## Problem Statement
Many existing bridges depend on centralized groups of relayers, limiting the choices available to dApp developers and reducing system resilience. Setting up a bridge with a decentralized set of relays can be challenging, necessitating a more robust and flexible solution.
