# Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Committees

## Summary
Protocols can establish robust security guarantees by harnessing Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and constructing a decentralized network of TEEs through EigenLayer, referred to as TEE Committees. This combination enhances reliability and security by requiring both majority collusion and a breach of the TEE security model to compromise the system.

## Problem Statement
Ensuring the integrity and privacy of computations in a decentralized environment is challenging. Existing solutions may rely on either centralized trust or are vulnerable to various attacks. A decentralized and secure solution leveraging multiple TEE models is needed to provide robust security guarantees.

## Proposed Solution
Implement TEE Committees by combining multiple TEE models, such as Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, and Amazon Nitro, and leveraging EigenLayer for decentralized and economic trust. This approach requires at least one sign-off from each TEE model, making it highly resistant to breaches. The decentralization and economic trust are absorbed from EigenLayer, providing a strong foundation for secure and private computations.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Security**: Requires breaking multiple distinct TEE models and majority collusion to compromise the system.
- **Privacy**: Provides privacy in the normal mode, protecting the TEE from attacks.
- **Decentralization**: Leverages EigenLayer for decentralized trust and slashing mechanisms.

## Technical Details

- **Architecture**: 
  The TEE Committee service will consist of nodes that:
  1. Use various TEE models (Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, Amazon Nitro).
  2. Form a decentralized network of TEEs for secure and private computations.
  3. Require sign-off from each TEE model for validation.
  
- **Components**:
  - **TEE Nodes**: Nodes running different TEE models for secure computations.
  - **Decentralized Trust Mechanism**: Utilize EigenLayer for decentralized trust and economic slashing.
  - **Validation Nodes**: Nodes that validate computations and require sign-offs from each TEE model.
  
- **Technologies**:
  - **Intel SGX**: For secure computations.
  - **ARM TrustZone**: For secure computations.
  - **Amazon Nitro**: For secure computations.
  - **EigenLayer**: For decentralized and economic trust.
  
- **Implementation Plan**:
  1. **Design Service Architecture**: Define roles and responsibilities of TEE and validation nodes.
  2. **Integrate TEE Models**: Implement and integrate multiple TEE models.
  3. **Set Up Nodes**: Deploy TEE and validation nodes with substantial Ethereum stakes.
  4. **Economic Trust Integration**: Implement mechanisms to leverage EigenLayer for economic trust and slashing.
  5. **Testing and Validation**: Thoroughly test the service for reliability, security, and privacy.
  6. **Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation and usage guidelines.
  
- **Challenges**:
  - **Ensuring Compatibility**: Integrating multiple distinct TEE models.
  - **Security**: Protecting the TEE and validation process from attacks.

## Use Cases
- **Secure Computations**: Ensuring the integrity and privacy of computations in decentralized applications.
- **Data Privacy**: Providing privacy-preserving computations for sensitive data.
- **Cross-Chain Security**: Enhancing the security of cross-chain interactions and transactions.
