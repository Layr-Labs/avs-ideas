## Event Driven Activation (EDA) with Keeper Networks

## Summary
Keeper networks provide a mechanism for users to initiate specific actions based on predefined conditions. These networks deploy nodes that respond to 'if-this-then-that' demands, ensuring tasks are completed efficiently and reliably.

## Problem Statement
Managing positions in DeFi protocols, such as preventing collateral liquidation, can be challenging and costly due to high gas fees and the need for constant monitoring. Users need a reliable and cost-effective solution to automate these processes.

## Proposed Solution
Implement a keeper network that supports both non-time-sensitive and time-sensitive actions. This network will enable users to automatically manage their positions and perform other critical tasks without incurring high gas fees or constant manual oversight.

## Benefits
- **Automation**: Automatically manage DeFi positions to avoid liquidation.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Reduce the burden of high gas fees.
- **Reliability**: Ensure tasks are completed promptly and accurately through a network of trusted nodes.
- **Economic Guarantees**: Provide economic guarantees for task fulfillment.

### Architecture
The keeper network consists of nodes that monitor on-chain events and respond to predefined conditions. There are two types of keeper networks:
1. **Non-Time-Sensitive Actions**: Suitable for tasks that do not require immediate action, such as raising challenges to optimistic rollups or managing bridge relays.
2. **Time-Sensitive Actions**: Necessary for tasks requiring quick responses, such as preventing collateral liquidation or executing trades.

### Components
- **Monitoring Nodes**: Continuously monitor on-chain events and conditions.
- **Execution Nodes**: Execute actions based on predefined conditions.
- **Economic Trust Mechanism**: Penalize nodes engaging in misconduct.

### Technologies Used
- **EVM**: For executing smart contracts and on-chain actions.
- **EigenLayer**: For ensuring Ethereum inclusion trust, where validators commit to prioritizing and fulfilling requests.
- **Solidity**: For writing smart contracts
- **Go / Rust / Python**: For writing off-chain computation software. 

### Implementation Plan
1. **Design Network Architecture**: Define the roles and responsibilities of monitoring and execution nodes.
2. **Develop Smart Contracts**: Create smart contracts that specify the conditions and actions for the keeper network.
3. **Deploy Nodes**: Set up and deploy nodes to monitor and execute tasks.
4. **Testing and Optimization**: Test the network for reliability and efficiency. Optimize for cost and performance.
5. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation and guidelines for users and developers.

### Challenges
- **Latency**: Ensuring timely execution of time-sensitive actions.
- **Security**: Protecting the network from malicious nodes and ensuring economic trust.

## Use Cases
- **DeFi Position Management**: Automatically manage collateral to avoid liquidation.
- **NFT Minting**: Automatically mint new NFTs based on specific conditions.
- **Token Trades**: Execute token trades in response to on-chain events.

## Market Research
There is a growing demand for automation in DeFi and other blockchain-based applications. Users seek solutions that can reduce their operational burden and minimize costs.

## Competitor Analysis
Existing solutions may either lack the automation capabilities or incur high gas fees. Keeper networks offer a cost-effective and reliable alternative by leveraging economic trust and Ethereum inclusion trust.

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk**: Latency issues for time-sensitive actions.
  - *Mitigation*: Implement optimization techniques and conduct thorough testing.
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities.
  - *Mitigation*: Utilize robust security practices and conduct regular audits.
