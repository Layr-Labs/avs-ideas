# Reorg Resistance

## Summary
Develop a service that leverages the economic trust provided by Ethereum to enhance resistance to chain reorganizations (reorgs) for other blockchains. This service will ensure that nodes with substantial stake in Ethereum attest to the block header of the most recently finalized block, providing an additional layer of security.

## Problem Statement
Chain reorganizations can undermine the security and stability of a blockchain. To be considered secure, a blockchain must resist such reorgs. Leveraging the economic trust of Ethereum can significantly enhance this resistance, but a robust service is needed to implement this effectively.

## Proposed Solution
Develop a service where nodes with significant Ethereum stake attest to the block header of the most recently finalized block of the chain. These nodes will run the chain's light client to verify the finalized block, ensuring it has not been double-signed and is built on the most recently finalized block. This will establish a new confirmation rule for any client on the chain, requiring verification that the block header has been finalized by the chain and attested by sufficient stake from EigenLayer.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Security**: Provides stronger resistance to chain reorganizations.
- **Economic Trust**: Utilizes the substantial economic trust of Ethereum.
- **Reliable Verification**: Ensures blocks are verified by nodes with significant stakes.

## Technical Details

- **Architecture**: 
  The service will consist of nodes that:
  1. Run the chain's light client to verify finalized blocks.
  2. Attest to the block header of the most recently finalized block.
  3. Ensure no double-signing and correct block construction on the most recently finalized block.
  
- **Components**:
  - **Light Client Nodes**: Run the chain's light client to verify finalized blocks.
  - **Attestation Nodes**: Nodes with substantial Ethereum stake that attest to the finalized block headers.
  - **Economic Trust Mechanism**: Utilize EigenLayer to ensure economic trust and penalize nodes for misconduct.
  
- **Technologies**:
  - **Ethereum**: For staking and attestation.
  - **EigenLayer**: For economic trust and validation.
  - **Light Clients**: For verifying the blockchain's finalized blocks.
  
- **Implementation Plan**:
  1. **Design Service Architecture**: Define roles and responsibilities of light client nodes and attestation nodes.
  2. **Develop Light Client**: Create or adapt a light client for the target blockchain.
  3. **Set Up Attestation Nodes**: Deploy nodes with substantial Ethereum stakes to perform attestations.
  4. **Economic Trust Integration**: Implement mechanisms to leverage EigenLayer for economic trust.
  5. **Testing and Validation**: Thoroughly test the service for reliability and security.
  6. **Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation and usage guidelines.
  
- **Challenges**:
  - **Ensuring Timely Attestations**: Maintaining timely and accurate attestations.
  - **Security**: Protecting the attestation process from malicious actors.

## Use Cases
- **Blockchain Security**: Enhancing the security of blockchains by resisting chain reorganizations.
- **Cross-Chain Applications**: Providing additional security for cross-chain applications and interactions.
