# AI Inference

## Summary
With the advent of trained open-source large AI models, users inferencing these models on new queries is becoming increasingly popular. However, the current landscape is dominated by a few centralized entities running AI inference engines. Running AI inferences onchain offers several compelling advantages, including program integrity, session privacy, and federated learning. EigenLayer aims to broaden the market for computational integrity in machine learning by offering decentralized, cost-effective, and secure AI inference solutions.

## Problem Statement
The current AI inference landscape is centralized, with few entities controlling the majority of inference engines. This centralization poses risks to program integrity, privacy, and the decentralization needed for federated learning. Additionally, zero-knowledge (ZK) techniques for ensuring computation integrity in ML can be prohibitively expensive, limiting broader adoption.

## Proposed Solution
Implement AI inference onchain using EigenLayer to leverage its decentralized trust and economic mechanisms. By inheriting economic trust from Ethereum, EigenLayer can provide cost-effective, secure, and decentralized AI inference services. This approach ensures program integrity, session privacy, and supports federated learning by enabling multiple actors to participate in AI training while preserving dataset privacy.

## Benefits
- **Program Integrity**: Ensures the integrity of AI inferences by leveraging decentralized trust and economic mechanisms from EigenLayer.
- **Session Privacy**: Protects consumer queries by ensuring only a significant portion of colluding operators can decrypt the complete set of queries.
