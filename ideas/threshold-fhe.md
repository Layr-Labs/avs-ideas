# Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

## Summary
Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables distributed computation on encrypted data, delivering robust privacy guarantees. By utilizing a decentralized network, such as EigenLayer, threshold-FHE ensures privacy and security while performing computations on sensitive data.

## Problem Statement
Sensitive data, such as medical records, requires strong privacy guarantees during computation. Existing solutions may expose data to potential leaks or require centralized trust, which is susceptible to attacks. A decentralized, privacy-preserving solution is needed for secure computation on sensitive data.

## Proposed Solution
Implement threshold-FHE using EigenLayer nodes to perform distributed computation on encrypted data. This method involves encrypting sensitive data using threshold encryption, distributing secret key shares among a decentralized network of EigenLayer operators, and performing computations on the encrypted data while preserving privacy and security.

## Benefits
- **Privacy**: Ensures data remains encrypted during computation, protecting sensitive information.
- **Security**: Uses a decentralized network to prevent collusion and liveness attacks.
- **Decentralization**: Leverages EigenLayer nodes for decentralized trust and computation.
